# Groundwork track notes

Notes for the groundwork PRs, folded into `docs/jack.md` at the end (design §2.2).

- **`@napi-rs/canvas` override.** The root `package.json` pins `pdfjs-dist>@napi-rs/canvas` to 1.0.10 (`pnpm.overrides`), because the newest release (1.0.13) was a day old when pdfjs-dist was added on 10/22. Remove the override once a newer release is at least two weeks old (from 11/04), then run `pnpm install` and commit the lockfile.
